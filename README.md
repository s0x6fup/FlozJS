# FlozJS (Finance and Loans OrganiZation)
Welcome to my project!
This is a vulnerable web applicaiton I created while studying NodeJS.
THe intended path to solve this lab is with a black box apprach, meaning you don't need to look at the code in order to solve it.
However, you can still look at the code if you want to practice code analysis.
If you get stuck I provided hints within the "hints" folder.
The "examples" folder contains scripts that I've written while learning NodeJS, I used them as reference as well while writing this lab.

Have fun! :)

# Requirements
Download NodeJS of a current version preferably, otherwise some packages will cause errors and the lab will not work.

# Lab setup
install dependecies
```bash
npm install
```

Start MongoDB database
```bash
sudo docker-compose -f config/docker-compose.yml up -d
```

Start / Restart lab
```bash
node app.js
```
